    <h3>Frankincence</h3>
    <p>
     Frankincense, specifically Boswellia carteri, is a resinous aromatic material that is derived from the Boswellia tree. 
     It has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and religious ceremonies due to its believed healing and
      spiritual properties. Somalia is renowned for producing some of the highest quality frankincense in the world, 
      particularly Boswellia carteri, which is considered to be one of the finest grades of frankincense. The resin 
      is carefully harvested by hand from the bark of the tree, then sorted and graded by quality to ensure that only 
      the best resin is selected for use. The high quality of Boswellia carteri from Somalia is attributed to the country's 
      unique climate, soil, and cultivation methods,#as well as the skill and knowledge of local harvesters who have been 
      harvesting frankincense for generations.

<h3>Myrrh</h3>
<p>
  Myrrh is a valuable resinous substance extracted from the Commiphora myrrha tree, which is indigenous to Somalia's dry and
   arid regions. Somalia is renowned for producing some of the world's highest quality myrrh, with the resin highly prized for its therapeutic 
   and aromatic properties. The myrrh resin is carefully harvested by hand, with local harvesters making small incisions in the tree's bark 
   to allow the resin to flow out and harden into gum-like tears. The tears are then sorted and graded by quality, with only the best 
   quality selected for use. Somali myrrh is known for its unique, rich aroma and purity, which is attributed to the region's distinctive
    climate, soil, and growing conditions. The production of myrrh is also an important source of income for local communities in
     Somalia, supporting sustainable economic development and providing employment opportunities.
