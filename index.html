    <h3>Frankincence</h3>
    <p>
     Frankincense, specifically Boswellia carteri, is a resinous aromatic material that is derived from the Boswellia tree. 
     It has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and religious ceremonies due to its believed healing and
      spiritual properties. Somalia is renowned for producing some of the highest quality frankincense in the world, 
      particularly Boswellia carteri, which is considered to be one of the finest grades of frankincense. The resin 
      is carefully harvested by hand from the bark of the tree, then sorted and graded by quality to ensure that only 
      the best resin is selected for use. The high quality of Boswellia carteri from Somalia is attributed to the country's 
      unique climate, soil, and cultivation methods,#as well as the skill and knowledge of local harvesters who have been 
      harvesting frankincense for generations.
